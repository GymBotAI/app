# Screens folder

This folder contains all the screens for the app.

## Rules

- Screens may be grouped and nested in folders if they are related to each other.
- A [navigator][1] should be created for each group of screens. A navigator should look like this:
  ```
  ğŸ§­ MyNavigator
  â”œ ğŸ“² Screen1
  â”‚ â”œ ğŸ“‚ components
  â”‚ â”‚ â”” ğŸ“„ Component1
  â”‚ â”” ğŸ“„ index.tsx
  â”œ ğŸ“² Screen2.tsx
  â”” ğŸ“„ index.tsx
  ```
  Where `MyNavigator` is a folder containing a `index.tsx` file which exports a navigator component.
- A navigator shouldn't contain any non-navigation logic or state[^1]

[^1]: Maybe there can be exceptions to this rule, but please discuss it with the team first.
